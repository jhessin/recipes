Combine sugar, cocoa, butter and milk in a saucepan and boil over medium heat for1 minute. Stirring constantly, fold in remaining ingredients. Drop with a teaspoon on wax paper and let harden. Work quickly because the hardening doesn't take long. Store in an airtight container because they can also dry out.
