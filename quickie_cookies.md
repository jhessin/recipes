# QUICKIE COOKIES A LA STOVE TOP

## Ingredients

### Boil

- 1 cup sugar
- 2 Tb Cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter or margarine
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/2 ts vanilla

### Dry

- 1/4 cup (4 tbsp.) peanut butter
- 1 1/2 cups oatmeal, uncooked
- 1/2 cup toasted wheat germ or quick oats

## Directions

Combine sugar, cocoa, butter and milk in a saucepan and boil over medium heat
for 1 minute. Stirring constantly, fold in remaining ingredients. Drop with a
teaspoon on wax paper and let harden. Work quickly because the hardening doesn't
take long. Store in an airtight container because they can also dry out.
